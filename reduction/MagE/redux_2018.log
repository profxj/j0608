# Plan
mage_plan, 'Raw/'

# Calibrations
domeflat = Red
Xe-Fl = Green
Xe-Fl = Blue

Trace looks ok;  Used a few dome flats

Flat looks a bit dodgy to the blue..
  Consider just using all 1's
  Better after I got the right Orders.fits extension

# Sensitivity function
  -- Complaining about bluest orders (no shocker)
  -- Looks pretty good overall
  -- Made LTT1788_std_1.00.sav

# Science frames

  -- Needed to not combine the bluest few orders
  -- Edited Flux/mage_esi_echcombspec.pro directly and then edited it back
     if not keyword_set(ORDRS) then ordrs=[6L,17L]  ;removed the orders from the call
