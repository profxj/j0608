# Plan
mage_plan, 'Raw/'

# Calibrations
domeflat = Red
Xe-Fl = Green
Xe-Fl = Blue

Trace looks ok;  Used a few dome flats

Flat crashed in order 20
  Fussed in mage_makeflat.pro
And turned off illumination flat (should
probably have done the same for the J0608 data)


# Sensitivity function
  -- Using Dec 2017

# Science frames
  -- Copied over the sensitivity function and the ObjStr0001.fits files
  -- Order 6 had insufficient number of arclines
  -- Object profile sure looks mushy, e.g. 2 objects
  -- Looks much better in the 2nd exposure.  Must have been bad guiding

# Coadding
  -- Crashed out in order 19 (as I did with J0608)
  -- if not keyword_set(ORDRS) then ordrs=[6L,18L]  ; mage_esi_echcombspec.pro

# Results
  Look ok!
